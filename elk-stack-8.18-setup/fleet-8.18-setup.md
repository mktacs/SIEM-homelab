## Steps:
### 1. Fleet server creation
- luckily I didn't need to manually install 8.18 version of elastic agent, kibana automatically suggests this version is required.
- first of all I had to create a fleet server, which must contain a name and URL
- navigate to **Fleet > Agents**, then choose **Add fleet server**
- First of all new policy creation required.
  - For the fleet server I disabled both logs and metrics, cause I don't need any logs from the server itself in my case
  - So I've unchecked "Collect system logs and metrics" and "Collect agent logs", "Collect agent metrics" in advanced settings, see the screenshots below:

- Then I defined fleet name and URL:
  - **Name**: Any identifier you like (e.g., `fleet-server-01`)
  - **URL**: Must be the IP address or domain of the machine hosting the Fleet Server (not `localhost` unless you're into pain)

### 2. Agent installation
- Select the **Linux x86_64** platform when prompted.
- Kibana will generate a command to drop into cli in order to install the agent with correct token and config.
- After installation the agent will appear, status should be "Healthy", see the screenshot below:

### Notes and issues
- If the Elastic Agent appears as Offline after a reboot, make sure the Fleet config uses your machineâ€™s local IP `192.168.x.x`, not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`

That's it for the fleet setup. With everything set on my server I moved to [victim-machine-setup](../victim-machine-setup/)

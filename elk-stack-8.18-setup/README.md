## Why am I installing another server with older ELK stack version?
- Previous installation of ELK stack 9.1.0 ([server-setup-notes](server-setup-notes)) appeared to have a critical bug which is not allowing me to proceed with my homelab goals.
- Here is the [bug report](https://github.com/elastic/beats/issues/45693) of the exact bug that I experienced.
- I decided to install another VM, with the Ubuntu Server this time, and ELK stack version 8.18.0
- Starting with [ubuntu-server-install.md](./ubuntu-server-install.md)

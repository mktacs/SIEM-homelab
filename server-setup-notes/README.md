## Rebuilt lab from scratch, see [elk-stack-8.18-setup](/elk-stack-8.18-setup)
Even though I set everything up correctly and the ELK stack itself was working, I encountered a bug that didn't allow me to configure Windows logs shipping, see [bug report.](https://github.com/elastic/beats/issues/45693)

Furthermore, I decided to go with Ubuntu Server, originally I thought that Ubuntu Desktop edition would work fine but it required too much RAM.

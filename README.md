# SIEM-homelab
Setting up a SIEM homelab to get some hands-on experience
### Goals
The purpose of this project is to setup a home-based Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation environment. The primary goal is to enhance practical cybersecurity skills and knowledge across areas such as:
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Log collection, parsing, and correlation
- Threat detection and response
- Automation and alerting
- Reporting and visualization

### Tools (Will add new tools in progress)
- Virtualization: VirtualBox
- Operating Systems: Windows (Victim), Ubuntu Server (ELK server), Kali (Attacker)
- SIEM: ~~Splunk (free edition)~~ ELK stack (Splunk is not sending a verification email for some reason)
- Network Monitoring: Wireshark/Snort

### Progress tracker
- [x] Define architecture and objectives
- [x] Deploy vulnerable machine
- [x] Configure SIEM and log shipping
- [ ] Simulate attack scenarios
- [ ] Analyze the logs, practice with SIEM
- [ ] Create response playbooks
- [ ] Final documentation and summary

### Notes
For now it is just a rough outline, I will continue to supplement the project during the process.
This project is for educational and professional purposes only.
All activities are conducted in a safe, isolated, and legal environment.
